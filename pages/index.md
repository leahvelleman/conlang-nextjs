Tequi is a [constructed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language). I didn't make it for international communication or science fiction, but just for the sake of making something.



When I picture its speakers, I picture modern people in a cold, green, rainy place. They like old pickup trucks and huge multi-family farmhouses. They farm, fish, travel, trade, read, and write.
