### Vowel sounds

Tequi has five vowels, including a distinctive high central vowel **y** that might remind you of Slavic languages, Turkish, or Japanese. The vowel **u** is rare, and mostly occurs in words where a historical **w** was lost.

- [i]
- **y**
- [ɨ]
- **u**

- **e**

- **o**

**Y** is pronounced `[z]` after **s** or **ts**, and `[ɻ]` after **sh**, **ch**, or **r**.

{% phonexample fts=["sizzle", "foo", "bar"] content=concat($sizzle, $def, $dem) /%}

All six vowels can be long as well as short. Write long vowels with a macron: **ā ē ī ō ū ȳ**.

There are nine diphthongs. Just like **u**, the diphthong **iu** is rare.

Diphthongs can also be long as well as short. Write the macron on the second letter: **iā iē iō iȳ iū uā uē uī uȳ**.

Diphthongs starting in **i** can't occur after **sh** or **ch**, and diphthongs starting in **u** can't occur after **wh**, **qu**, or **w**.

### Consonant sounds

Tequi has 19 consonant sounds. The sounds **hp ht hk** are rare at the beginnings of words.

**Sh** and **ch** change pronunciation to `[ʂ]` and `[tʂ]` before **y**. (In other words, **shy** is `[ʂɻ]` and **chy** is `[tʂɻ]`.)

The consonants fall into three categories: _hard,_ _soft,_ and _neutral._

- **qu**
- **wh**
- **w**

- **’**
- **h**

{% /table %}

Morphological alternations between hard and soft sounds are common. Alternations between hard and neutral sounds sometimes occur.

### Syllables

Tequi has no consonant clusters. A syllable can start with a single consonant, no more. Only the last syllable of a word can end in a consonant, and it can only end in **h** or **’**.



#### Lenition



#### Mutation

A hard sound disappears. But a following soft sound changes into a hard one.

A soft sound disappears. But a following hard sound changes into a soft one.

A neutral sound disappears with no effect.




### Basic consonants?

A linguist would want to know how many consonant _phonemes_ Tequi has. In other words, if you wanted to write it with a few basic consonants, and treat the other sounds as variant pronunciations, how few could you get away with?

The Tequi alphabet only distinguishes 9 basic consonants. It spells the other sounds using combinations of these basic consonants, or as combinations of a consonant with a glide.

So could Tequi only have 9 consonant phonemes? Well, maybe — but it's a bit of a stretch. In particular, you'd have to argue that Tequi had a _silent glide_ which corresponded to /ɨ/ but was never pronounced. So for instance, **si** would be /sɨ̯i/, with the /ɨ̯/ totally silent. This works fine as a spelling rule, but it seems far-fetched as a phonological one. (It's a bit like claiming that English silent **e** was a real phoneme.)
